Each solver (OR-Tools, Choco, Exact, ...) has is own unique interface. And thus each solver exposes their own unique set of options that we can start tweaking in order to get more performance out of it. By default, solvers will often use some heuristic as to guess what a good set of options could be. In order to stay performant, not much time on this optimization will be spend. We on the other hand can do our own experiments and figure out which set of settings work best for the particular problem that we're trying to solve.\n",
