    "## Job-Shop Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to schedule the processing of the tasks from different jobs in several machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task is labelled by a pair of numbers (`m`, `p`) where `m` is the number of the machine and `p` is the processing time of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three jobs: For example, job `0` has three tasks. The first, `(0, 3)`, must be processed on machine `0` in `3` units of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "job 0 = [(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2)]\n",
    "job 1 = [(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 4)]\n",
    "job 2 = [(1, 4), (2, 3)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of constraints for the job-shop problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Precedence constraint: for any two consecutive tasks in the same job, the first must be completed before the second can be started.\n",
    "2. No-overlap constraint: a machine can't work on two tasks at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the job-shop problem is to minimize the makespan: the length of time from the earliest start time of the jobs to the latest end time."
